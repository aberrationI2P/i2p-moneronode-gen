# [WIP] DO NOT USE [WIP]

Based on the [eyedeekay's i2p plugin](https://github.com/eyedeekay/i2p.plugins.monero) to automatically set up a monero node on the native Java Router.

# What is different?

This project aims to automatically generate a node that operates on a hybrid system of communicating with node peers on the onion network (ideally I could add options in the future to change this as one would see fit) while retaining control and access to the RPC through an I2P Tunnel.
